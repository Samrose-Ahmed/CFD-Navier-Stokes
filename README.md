# CFD-Navier-Stokes
A collection of simple finite difference solutions in MATLAB building up to the Navier Stokes Equations.

Inspired by Lorena Barba's [CFD Python: 12 steps to Navier Stoke's](https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython/blob/master/README.md), a great resource for learning the fundamentals of CFD (using Python).
