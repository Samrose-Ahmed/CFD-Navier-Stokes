Solve the Advection equation\
![adveqn](adveqn.PNG)
using the first-order upwind method, Lax-Wendroff method, and Crank Nicolson method (using both second-order central difference and first-order backward dif-ference approximations for spatial derivative).

## Question 1
The boundary conditions are:
![Q1 BCs](q1_bcs.PNG)\
which is a move sine wave.

## Question 2
Boundary conditions:
![Q2 BCs](q2_bcs.PNG)\
which are two sine waves moving toward each other. Notice dispersive and disspative error.
