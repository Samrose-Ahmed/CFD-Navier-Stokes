## Problem
Consider fluid bounded by two parallel plates extended to infinity such that no end
effects are encountered. The lower wall is suddenly accelerated in the x-direction at
40 m/s. The spacing between two plates is denoted by h, and it is set to 0.04 m. 
The y-direction is taken perpendicular to the plates such that lower
plate lies in xz plane. 
This problem can be represented by following one-dimensional parabolic diffusion eqn u_t=nu*u_yy where
where nu is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.

We solve the equation using  first-order upwind method, Lax-Wendroff method and  Crank-Nicolson method.
